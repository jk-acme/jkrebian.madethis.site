# @tweetback/canonical

A package to resolve twitter URLs to new canonically hosted twitter backups.

## Installation

The package is available on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tweetback/canonical

```
npm install @tweetback/canonical
```

## Usage

```js
import {transform} from "@tweetback/canonical";

transform("https://twitter.com/zachleat");
// Returns "https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/"

transform("https://twitter.com/eleven_ty");
// Returns "https://twitter.11ty.dev/"
```

Works with status URLs:

```js
transform("https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/123");
// Returns "https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/123"
```

Other features:

* Passthrough any valid URLs as normal.
* Preserves trailing slashes (trailing slashes are optional)
* Normalizes duplicate slashes in the pathname

## Add your own Twitter Archive:

You needn‚Äôt use tweetback to add your archive here. The only requirement here is that your archive has URL parity and has individually addressable URLs for each status.

Just create a PR with your addition to the `mapping.js` file and we‚Äôll have a look!

Please start your commit message with `mapping: `, it helps speed up the npm package release process.

## The best example

This status https://twitter.11ty.dev/1559312029340557315 links to @TerribleMia‚Äôs archive which links _back_ to the @eleven_ty archive. Threading across archives üèÜ while allowing each instance to maintain their own data.
